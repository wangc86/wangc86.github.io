To have students assist in some projects that we\u0026rsquo;re working on in the lab.  In either case, we call for self-motivated spirits. Those who would like to participate must enroll in either CSU0037 or CSU0040 in the same semester.\nMaster program Due to my current capacity (both time and resource), this summer we can only admit at most three new master students.\nA CS master program is a two-year training in completing a reasonable sized research project. Master students should work largely independently, though we will have weekly individual meeting and group meeting to exchange ideas. In our lab, we emphasize hands-on experience in systems research, meaning that students will have ample opportunities to design, analyze, build, test, and evaluate their prototype CPS systems.\nCompared with the undergraduate eduation, where students spend most of their time learning the knowns, the graduate education is more about exploring the unknowns and learning to articulate new findings. In the graduate study in science and engineering, this means both the ability to compose and refine research work (as silver purified seven times) and the ability to present and defend the result (so that the silver is made into jewelry whose value is clearly seen). At NCL, we aim to help students develop both abilities.\nPhD program Working for a PhD degree requires much more significant effort, but it can be very rewarding. It is typically a 5\u0026ndash;7 years of concentration on a real, open, and important research problem.\nOn this journey, the student will gradually build up a unique view to a certain intellectual question in his field of study, and such a view will be framed into a theory or a system that he must be able to thoroughly evaluate and articulate in a formal manner. That is why the full name of PhD is Doctor of Philosophy.\nLike planting, the job of a research advisor for graduate students is to provide resource and guidance along the way, in the hope that those who decided to take on this journey may bear much fruits.\n","date":1647993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647993600,"objectID":"f5c7b8d39006a8102517c5b8fa5b2872","permalink":"https://wangc86.github.io/recruit/","publishdate":"2022-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/recruit/","section":"","summary":"(Last updated on March 23rd, 2022)\nThis post is for those who would like to join our lab and work on cyber-physical systems (CPS) at National Taiwan Normal University, in the department of computer science and information engineering.","tags":null,"title":"For Prospective Students","type":"page"},{"authors":["王超 Chao Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"Some years ago, in a second-hand Bible I came across a series of hand-written verse references, asking the reader to turn to the pages here and there.

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\n \u0026ndash;John 3:16-17\n There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.\n \u0026ndash;1 Corinthians 10:13\n that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n \u0026ndash;Romans 10:9-10\n (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)\n \u0026ndash;2 Corinthians 6:2\n Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.\n \u0026ndash;Acts 8:35-39\nAnd I would like to add three more verse references. First, of God the Father and His promise, from Isaiah 49:24-25:\n Shall the prey be taken from the mighty,\nor the lawful captive delivered?\nBut thus saith the Lord,\nEven the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,\nand the prey of the terrible shall be delivered:\nfor I will contend with him that contendeth with thee,\nand I will save thy children.\n And finally, of God the Son and His work, from Hebrews 2:14-15, and from Hebrews 7:24-25:\n Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.\n  but this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.\n ","date":1645228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645228800,"objectID":"5a0c32be394b671c69a5afacbd6a5f15","permalink":"https://wangc86.github.io/cr/","publishdate":"2022-02-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cr/","section":"","summary":"Some years ago, in a second-hand Bible I came across a series of hand-written verse references, asking the reader to turn to the pages here and there.
